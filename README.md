# SOCOLES-Grader

SOCOLES is a C++ powered SQL auto-grader with a JavaScript frontend

## Components

- **backend/** - C++ server engine that grades queries  
- **frontend/** - JS app for submitting queries & viewing results  

> For detailed build & run instructions, see the [backend README](backend/README.md) and [frontend README](frontend/README.md).

## âœ¨ Features

- **SELECT statements**
  Capable of grading SELECT (DQL) Queries.

- **DDL/DML statements**  
  Extends grading beyond SELECT (DQL) to include Data Definition (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) and Data Manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) statements.

- **Clause-level Analysis**  
  Evaluates each individual clause (e.g. `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`) in isolation, so you get fine-grained insight into query structure.

- **Clause-level Feedback**  
  Generates feedback at the clause or component level (e.g. pointing out a missing `CASCADE` in a `DROP TABLE`), helping students pinpoint exactly what went wrong.

- **Static & Dynamic Analysis**  
  *Static* checks the syntax tree against expected patterns; *dynamic* runs the query and inspects actual results for correctness.

- **Query Repair**  
  Auto-corrects minor syntax and semantic mistakes (typos, missing keywords) and suggests fixes.

- **Configurable Grading**  
  Instructors can tune:
  - Which properties to grade (syntax, semantics, results)  
  - Number of outcomes per property  
  - Property priorities  
  - Text/tree-edit distance thresholds

- **Correctness Levels**  
  Supports multiple levels of correctness.

- **Constraint Support**  
  Checks and grades table constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and foreign keys.


## ðŸš€ Quick Start


```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/berniegach/socoles-grader.git
cd socoles-grader

# 2. Build backend
cd backend
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make

# 3. Create & configure PostgreSQL database
#    This will create an empty database named `grader` and
#    give your current shell user ownership so the backend can connect.
createdb grader
psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE grader TO $(whoami);"

# 4. Start backend server
#    Note the `--db-name` now points to `grader`
./socoles_server 

# 5. Build & run frontend
cd ../../frontend
npm install
npm start
```
